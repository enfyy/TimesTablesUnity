# Times Tables Unity
I saw this ![Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8) recently because i stumbled upon this ![blog post](https://www.redblobgames.com/x/1847-mathologer-modulo-circle/#N=500&M=2&color=angle) and it made me want to implement it in Unity.
So thats what i did and a little extra. Instead of just having 2D i also added a 3D mode that draws circles instead of lines.

Unity Version used: 2020.1.2f1

How to use:
- Need to use URP/HDRP because of Shader Graph
- Create a Material with the shader.
- Create a empty Game object and slap the Script and the Material on it.
